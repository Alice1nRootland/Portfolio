Although Byte Bandits was the first to solve all machines, I also attempted each one independently during the challenge.
I managed to solve 4 machines on my own, capturing all user flags and 2 root flags. 
This repository includes both my personal documentation and Byte Bandits' full walkthroughs for educational sharing.
